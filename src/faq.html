        What is Ethereum's London Hard Fork?
      </button>
      <div class="acc-content">
        <p style="color: white;">
          Ethereum's London Hard Fork are a set of 5 Ethereum improvement proposals that aim to change the speed and incentivisation of Ethereum mining. Since Ethereum is regarded as an inflationary cryptocurrency, there is no limit on its count and miners are rewarded with fresh, new coins each time they validate a block. They are then compensated with transaction fees paid by users. However, per Ethereum's London Hard Fork proposal, once the update is rolled out, miners will not receive income from transaction fees, thereby reducing the supply of this cryptocurrency and giving it a much-required boost. This update aims to make transaction fees more predictable for investors using blockchain technology.

        What is double spending?
      </button>
      <div class="acc-content">
        <p style="color: white;">
          Double spending is a potential issue in digital currencies where the same digital token can be spent more than once. This is a unique problem for digital money, as digital information can be replicated easily. Bitcoin addresses this issue through its decentralized ledger, the blockchain. When a Bitcoin transaction is made, it's broadcast to a network of computers (nodes). These nodes verify the transaction's legitimacy and its history, ensuring the same bitcoins haven't been spent previously. Once verified, the transaction is added to a block in the blockchain, which is then confirmed by miners.

        What is Bitcoin mining?
      </button>
      <div class="acc-content">
        <p style="color: white;">
          Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation and the network is secured. It involves solving complex computational puzzles using specialized hardware. Miners compete to solve these puzzles, and the first one to find a solution gets to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, a decentralized public ledger. In return for their efforts, miners are rewarded with a certain number of bitcoins, as well as transaction fees paid by users. This mining process not only introduces new bitcoins at a controlled rate, adhering to Bitcoin's cap of 21 million total coins, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining and securing the Bitcoin network, making it resistant to fraud and attacks.
